## Youtube website

This website contains information about youtube channels that focus on 
embracing new experiences and going outside your comfort zone

### The website features 3 youtube channels in particular:

The website also features a poll that displays results in a pie chart 
and a login page that allows youtube channel owners to login 
and add a post to the posts page of the website
